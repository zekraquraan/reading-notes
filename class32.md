# What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?
Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions:
DRF provides a set of built-in permissions that control access to different API views. The key components and purposes of DRF permissions are as follows:
AllowAny: This permission class allows unrestricted access to the view. It is commonly used for public APIs or views that don't require authentication.

IsAuthenticated: This permission class requires users to be authenticated (logged in) to access the view. It is suitable for views that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

IsAdminUser: This permission class restricts access to admin users only. It is useful for views that should only be accessible by users with admin privileges.

IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: This permission class allows authenticated users to have full access to the view, while unauthenticated users can only read (GET) the data but cannot modify it.

IsAuthenticatedOrTokenHasScope: This permission class is used with OAuth2 authentication to check if the user's token has the required scope to access the view.

Custom Permissions: DRF also allows you to define your custom permission classes to implement more complex access control logic tailored to your application's requirements.

DRF permissions help secure an API by controlling who can access specific views and perform certain actions. They help prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or performing operations they are not allowed to.

# In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

SQL SELECT Statement:
The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, the table you want to query, and any conditions to filter the results. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM employees;
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents all columns in the 'employees' table. This query will return all rows and columns from the 'employees' table.

# Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
DRF Generic Views:
DRF provides a set of generic class-based views that simplify the creation of common API views. They encapsulate common patterns and reduce boilerplate code. The main DRF Generic Views are:
GenericAPIView: This is the base view that provides the core functionality for all other generic views.

ListAPIView: This view is used for read-only endpoints that return a list of objects. It is typically used to retrieve a list of objects from the database.

CreateAPIView: This view is used for creating new objects. It handles HTTP POST requests to create new records.

RetrieveAPIView: This view is used to retrieve a single object by its primary key. It handles HTTP GET requests for a single object.

UpdateAPIView: This view is used to update a single object by its primary key. It handles HTTP PUT or PATCH requests for a single object.

DestroyAPIView: This view is used to delete a single object by its primary key. It handles HTTP DELETE requests for a single object.

ListCreateAPIView: This view combines ListAPIView and CreateAPIView, allowing both listing objects and creating new ones in a single view.

RetrieveUpdateAPIView: This view combines RetrieveAPIView and UpdateAPIView, allowing both retrieving and updating a single object.

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: This view combines RetrieveAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView, providing all CRUD operations for a single object.

Example of Usage:
Let's say you have a model called 'Book' and you want to create an API to list all books and allow users to create new books. You can use DRF Generic Views as follows:


from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookListCreateView(ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
In this example, the BookListCreateView is a combination of the ListAPIView and CreateAPIView, providing both listing and creating functionalities. The queryset attribute defines the queryset to retrieve all books from the database, and the serializer_class attribute specifies the serializer to convert the model data to JSON and vice versa.
