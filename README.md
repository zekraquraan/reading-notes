## relational databases and SQL :A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables, which are related to each other through common fields or keys. The data in each table is organized in rows and columns, where each column represents a specific attribute of the data (such as a name or a date), and each row represents a specific instance of the data (such as a customer or an order). The relationships between tables are defined by using foreign keys, which allow data to be shared between tables.

## Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. SQL allows you to perform a wide range of tasks on your data, including creating tables and databases, inserting and updating data, querying data to extract information, and deleting data.

## Some common SQL commands that you may encounter include:

## SELECT: used to retrieve data from one or more tables
## INSERT: used to insert new data into a table
## UPDATE: used to update existing data in a table
## DELETE: used to delete data from a table
## CREATE: used to create a new table or database
## ALTER: used to modify the structure of an existing table or database
## JOIN: used to combine data from multiple tables based on a common key
## SQL is a powerful and widely used language, and it is essential for anyone who works with relational databases. Whether you are a developer, a data analyst, or a business analyst, having a solid understanding of SQL can help you to work more efficiently and effectively with data.
