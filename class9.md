## What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers.

new_list = [expression for item in iterable]
In this syntax:

new_list is the new list that will be created.
expression is the operation or calculation that will be applied to each item in the iterable.
item represents the current item being processed in the iterable.
iterable is the source of items, such as a list, tuple, or any other iterable object.
List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. It differs from using a for loop to create a list in terms of readability and brevity. List comprehensions allow you to achieve the same result in a more compact and expressive manner.

Here's an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)
Output:

csharp
Copy code
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In the above example, the expression x**2 squares each element x in the numbers list using list comprehension.
## What is a decorator in Python?

A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without directly changing its source code. It is a higher-order function that takes a function as input and returns a new function as output. Decorators provide a way to extend or enhance the functionality of existing functions or classes by wrapping them with additional code.

Decorators are denoted by the @decorator_name syntax, where decorator_name is the name of the decorator function. They are typically used to add extra functionality such as logging, input validation, caching, or timing to functions.

## Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading.
The concept of decorators in Python works by taking a function as an argument, creating a new function that usually extends the behavior of the original function, and then returning the new function. This can be achieved using the @decorator_name syntax.

Here's an example of a simple decorator function that adds logging functionality to a function:


def log_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_decorator
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
Output:

bash

Calling function: greet
Hello, Alice!
In the example, the log_decorator function is a decorator that takes a function (func) as an argument. It defines an inner function (wrapper) that adds logging before and after calling func. The decorator returns the wrapper function, which is then used to wrap the greet function using the @log_decorator syntax. When greet is called, it first prints the log message before executing the original function's code.
