## Stack:
# A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed. The two primary operations in a stack are:

# Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
# Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
# Additional operations include:

# Peek/Top: Returns the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
Stacks have applications in various scenarios, such as function calls, expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and undo/redo operations.

Queue:
A queue is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a service, where the person who arrives first gets served first. The two primary operations in a queue are:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element from the queue.
Additional operations include:

Front: Returns the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
Queues have applications in various scenarios, such as task scheduling, event handling, breadth-first search, and printer spooling.

Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements of the application.
