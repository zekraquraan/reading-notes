# Data Structures and Algorithms

```
A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

### Discussion Questions:
1. ***It is important to state that no single data structure serves as an optimal solution for all problems. With that in mind, to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed.***
2. ***ensure that progress is made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call.***
