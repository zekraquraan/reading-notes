## Title: Introduction to Linked Lists

## WHAT is a Linked List?
# A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation. Instead, each node can be scattered in memory, connected through the links.

## WHY use Linked Lists?
# Linked lists offer several advantages over arrays in certain scenarios:

# Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size during program execution, as memory is allocated dynamically.
# Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion of nodes can be done efficiently in linked lists, as it only requires updating a few links, whereas in arrays, elements may need to be shifted.
# Memory Efficiency: Linked lists can save memory compared to arrays because they don't require a fixed block of memory and can utilize it more flexibly.


# Creating a Node:
# A node in a linked list typically contains two parts: a data field to store the value and a next field to store the reference to the next node.

## In conclusion, linked lists provide a flexible and efficient way to manage data, especially when dynamic size and frequent insertions and deletions are required.
